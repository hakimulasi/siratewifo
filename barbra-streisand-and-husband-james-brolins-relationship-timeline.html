And I walked by him. I put my hand through his hair and said, ‘Who f—ked up your hair?’”</p><p>Later that year, they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premiere of The Mirror Has Two Faces in November 1996.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Barbra-Streisand-and-Husband-James-Brolin-s-Relationship-Timeline-From-a-Blind-Date-to-Wedded-Bliss-231.jpg><h3>1998</h3><p>After two years of dating, Brolin and Streisand tied the knot in a star-studded ceremony in July 1998. <a href=#><strong>John Travolta</strong></a>, <a href=#>Kelly Preston</a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Rita Wilson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Quincy Jones</strong></a> and <strong>Sydney Pollack</strong> were all in attendance for the duo’s nuptials.</p><p>One month after walking down the aisle, Brolin received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Streisand was by his side for the ceremony.</p><h3>2000</h3><p>Streisand was awarded the National Medal of Arts by former <a href=#><strong>President Bill Clinton</strong></a>, and she was joined by Brolin at the White House.</p><h3>2003</h3><p>The pair attended the premiere of Brolin’s film A Guy Thing.
