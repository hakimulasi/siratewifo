<time>27 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>For Ice Cube and Kimberly Woodruff, there can be no better way to keep things together than friendship. In the hundreds of interviews Ice Cube has given over the years, he stresses the importance of friendship to maintain a relationship together. Coming from a man who is nearing three decades of togetherness with his wife Kimberly Woodruff, there must be some truth to his words. Unlike Cube, who is a renowned actor, comedian, and rapper, not much is known about Woodruff and Cube has been incredibly secretive about his wife. But given Cube’s fame, details ultimately came out. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Kimberly Woodruff.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bits and pieces:</h2><p>Kimberly ‘Kim’ Woodruff Jackson was born on the 23rd of September 1970, in California, USA. Born and raised in California, not much is known about Kimberly’s early life.&nbsp; Details on her parents, education, and early life remain a secret. On the academic side of things, while Kimberly finished high school in California, the validity of her college degree remains a question.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kimberly-Woodruff-husband-Ice-Cube.jpg><p>On the other hand, much of Kimberly’s career has been associated with Ice Cube, and not much is known about her professional life. She is often seen accompanying Cube to various red carpet and charity events.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Melting Ice Cube:</h2><p>Kimberly and Cube met for the first time in 1989 and even though Cube was attracted to her immediately, Woodruff denied all his approaches. She was in a committed relationship at the time. The pair met for the second time six months later and hit it off immediately. Talking about the pair’s first meeting, Cube <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>,</p><p>“The first thing I thought I was, ‘Wow, she could be your woman. The first time we met, she wasn’t feeling me, she was not having it. She did not dig me. I think she was in a relationship, so she wasn’t having it. But I ended up seeing her about six months later, and the next time, we had more time to get to know each other. She could feel my vibe and fell in love your with your boy!”</p><p>The pair began dating and got engaged three years later in 1992. Their first child, O’Shea Jackson Jr., was born out of Wedlock in Apr. 1991. The pair tied the knot on the 28th of November, 1992, and have been together ever since.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Staying together, children, and other things:</h2><p>The pair’s first child, O’ shea was followed by four more children. Darrell Jackson on the 29th of December 1992, Deja Jackson, Karima Jackson who was born on the 17th of February 1994, and Shareef Jackson on the 17th of November 1995. While some of his children have followed Cube into the industry, none of them have been as famous as O’Shea, who portrayed cube in his 2015 biopic “Straight Outta Compton.”</p><p>Even though Ice Cube and Kimberly Woodruff have been together for over three decades, Cube credits his wife for helping him to get through and staying together.</p><p>“She’s been everything. This business looks like it’s exciting all of the time, but sometimes it can get lonely. Especially when you’ve got a project out there and you really don’t have a place to kind of fall back on somebody who knows you for real and knows everything about you. Just to have her there fighting these battles with me this whole career has been awesome.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick bio of Ice Cube:</h2><p>Ice Cube is an American rapper, actor, producer, and writer.
