When he was 24 years old, he left that job after the network censored a story he produced that criticized the Mexican government. In 1983, Jorge obtained a student visa and went to Los Angeles with plans to attend journalism classes at the UCLA Extension. The following year, the Los Angeles-based Spanish International Network affiliate KMEX-TV hired him, and he said of the job, "To me it was a palace… the United States gave me opportunities that my country of origin could not: freedom of the press and complete freedom of expression." In 1987, Ramos began hosting the morning program "Mundo Latino" on KMEX, which soon became known as Univision. He then anchored the nightly newscast "Noticiero Univision" and hosted the weekly public affairs series "Al Punto" on the network, and he also hosted the Fusion TV program "America with Jorge Ramos." He has covered world events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Persian Gulf War, and the September 11th terrorist attacks and interviewed several world leaders, including <a href=# title="Bill Clinton Net Worth">Bill Clinton</a>, Barack Obama, Hugo Chávez, <a href=# title="George W.

In February 2019, Ramos and his journalistic group were held in Venezuela's Miraflores Palace after an interview with President <a href=# title="Nicolás Maduro Net Worth">Nicolás Maduro</a>. Their equipment and recordings were seized, and they were later released and deported from Venezuela.

He said of the decision, "You have to go through a mental and emotional process to recognize who you really are. I finally recognized that I cannot be defined by one country. I am from both countries. It took me many years to make peace with that thought, and that I was never going back to Mexico." In 1988, Ramos welcomed a daughter, Paola, with his first wife, Gina Montaner. Gina is the daughter of Carlos Alberto Montaner, an exiled Cuban author. Jorge and Gina divorced in 1990, and Paola lived with her mother in Spain. Ramos wed Lisa Bolivar in 1992 at the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista&nbsp; in Puerto Rico, and they had a son, Nicolas, before divorcing in 2005. Jorge later dated actress <a href=# title="Ana de la Reguera Net Worth">Ana de la Reguera</a>, and he began a relationship with actress/TV host Chiquinquirá Delgado in 2011.
