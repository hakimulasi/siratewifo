Her place of birth is Los Angeles, which means that her nationality is American. Her ethnicity on the other hand is a mixture of several heritages including Irish, Swedish, Chinese, German, and Norwegian on her mother’s side. Keasler’s mom is Shannon Lee, the second child of legendary martial artist and actor, Bruce Lee. It, therefore, means that Wren Keasler is the granddaughter of the late legend. Keasler’s mom, Shannon, only spent four years on the face of the earth before Bruce Lee passed away and this could have easily derailed her life.</p><p>She was however able to move on with the help of her mother, Linda, and is now a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>professionally-trained singer</a>, actress, movie producer, and businesswoman. Shannon has supplied her beautiful vocals to songs such as California Dreamin’, I’m in the Mood for Love, and The Mechanical Forces of Love. She has also scored bit parts in movies such as Cage II, High Voltage, Enter the Eagles, Epoch, and Martial Law. Shannon Lee is also a trained martial artist and an author. She now heads the Bruce Lee Foundation and the Bruce Lee family company. The former is dedicated to non-profit purposes while the latter licenses out various copyrighted materials belonging to the late Lee for-profit purposes.</p><p>Asides from her mother and grandfather, another famous relative in Wren Keasler’s background is her late uncle, Brandon Lee. Brandon was Shannon’s older brother and followed their father’s footsteps into acting and martial arts. He recorded some success appearing in movies and TV series such as Legacy of Rage, Kung Fu: The Movie, Kung Fu: The Next Generation, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Rapid Fire, and Crow. Much like his father before him, Brandon Lee died at the young age of 28 in 1993. This was due to an accident on a film set and Wren never got to meet her uncle as well.</p><h2><strong>Her Father is a Lawyer Named Ian Anthony Keasler</strong></h2><p>On her paternal side, Wren Keasler has Filipino, English, Jewish, German, Scottish, Welsh, and Japanese ancestry from her father, Ian Anthony Keasler. Ian is a native of Palm Springs, California, and a professionally trained lawyer. He studied at both Pepperdine University, as well as Tulane University Law School to qualify as an attorney. Ian and Wren’s mom, Shannon, are no longer together but it is worth recounting their story. The couple most likely crossed paths during the time that they were both students of Tulane University. They became attracted to each other and commenced a relationship in 1988. They dated for six years and got married on the 22nd of August 1994.</p><p>The couple made their home in California and welcomed their daughter, Wren, in the year 2003. They took care of her together for the next four years of her life but eventually filed for divorce in 2007. Ian and Shannon only cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and the whole process lasted up until 2011 before it was sorted out and the couple went their separate ways.</p><h2><strong>Wren Keasler is Currently Studying at Her Parents’ Alma Mater, Tulane University</strong></h2><p>Wren Lee Keasler’s parents are no longer together but they made sure that their divorce did not have any negative impact on their daughter. The young girl, therefore, had a pretty wonderful childhood and is thriving now. Even though she leads a very private life, and even has her social media accounts set to private, we still have a picture of what Wren Keasler’s life is like. She is presently a student at her parents’ alma mater, Tulane University. Her exact course of study is not known but she is set to graduate in 2025. Wren may be following in her mom’s footsteps by studying vocal performance or studying to be a lawyer like her dad. It is also possible that she is taking an entirely different route but one thing that is for sure is that she has a bright future ahead of her.</p><p>Asides from school, Wren Lee Keasler is said to be a lover of martial arts. This is something she undoubtedly inherited from her late grandfather, as well as her mom. The late Bruce Lee was not only a badass martial artist but also invented his own martial arts known as Jeet Kune Do. His daughter, Shannon, studied the hybrid martial art and it seems that Wren has also taken it up. She could also be trying out other forms of martial arts such as karate, taekwondo, judo, aikido, Muay Thai, kung fu, jujutsu, etc. The possibilities are endless but what is certain is that Keasler loves martial arts and has even been pictured hanging out with UFC president, Dana White.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/10/Wren-Keasler.jpg><h2><strong>She Manages Her Grandfather’s Official Snapchat Account</strong></h2><p>Wren Lee Keasler very well understands the importance of her family background and is doing her bit to keep her grandfather’s legacy alive. She has joined her mom at several events honoring her grandfather. One of them was the 2014 premiere of a Broadway play dedicated to Bruce Lee titled Kung Fu. She and her mother also attended the annual Bruce Lee Night organized by the NFL side, San Francisco Giants, in 2018. Wren Lee Keasler also manages her grandfather’s official <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Snapchat account</a> and joined her mom in wishing the late Bruce Lee a posthumous <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>happy 80th birthday</a> in November 2020.</p><p>Wren Lee Keasler is every inch a part and parcel of the Bruce Lee Foundation and the Bruce Lee Family Company and this makes her quite close to her mom. Her mother is super proud of her and never fails to praise her on social media. On one occasion in September 2019, Shannon posted a beautiful picture of the smiling Wren and described her as the exact picture of love. In her own words, her daughter is pure love and light and makes her a better person with each passing day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmavopq7brfEmqqlnaJiwKmtzaemp2WcmrK0ecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-wren-keasler-shannon-lees-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-wren-keasler-shannon-lees-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-wren-keasler-shannon-lees-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-wren-keasler-shannon-lees-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-wren-keasler-shannon-lees-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-wren-keasler-shannon-lees-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bridal-collections-you-need-to-know-about.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bridal-collections-you-need-to-know-about.html>14 Spring bridal collections you need to know about in 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./penguinz0s-girlfriend-list.html>Who is Penguinz0 Dating Penguinz0's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./penguinz0s-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
