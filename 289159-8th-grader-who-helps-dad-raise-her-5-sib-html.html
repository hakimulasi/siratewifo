The young teenager, who has dealt with many responsibilities in the past years, got a pleasant visit from the East Idaho Secret Santa.</p><p class=dh>Since 2020, family and friends watched 14-year-old Emily square her young shoulders and take over many responsibilities for her siblings after her mom passed. However, in the yuletide period of 2021, a close friend thought it was time for Emily to get a handsome reward for all her hard work.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE SECRET SANTA INITIATIVE</strong></p><p class=dh>The Secret Santa program was created to reward the Eastern Idaho residents and reach out to those in need during the yuletide. The initiative <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2022/01/mayors-choice-award-given-to-several-groups-and-individuals-including-eastidahonews-com/>started</a> in 2015, and with the help of the East Idaho News crew, it has seen tremendous progress.</p><p class=dh>Since its year of creation, the gift-sharing program has shelled out over $3 million in gift items like cars, gift cards, household items, furniture, and other necessities. The news director at East Idaho News, Nate Eaton, works alongside the anonymous Secret Santa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f4516e16265b125a8c5bbde51299cc53.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>The three news elves. | Source: youtube.com/East Idaho News</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>EMILY'S TOUCHING STORY</strong></p><p class=dh>In 2021, East Idaho's Secret Santa, who prefers to keep his identity from the public, came across the sad life story of a young girl in the community. Although very young, Emily had already <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3HjioazAUg">seen</a> a lot and had a lot on her hands.</p><p class=dh>Emily's friend, who has been close to her since the third grade, reached out to Secret Santa, penning a comprehensive chronicle of her struggles. The letter explained that Emily's grandma died of cancer when she was very young.</p><p class=dh>After her grandmother's death, Emily became apprehensive that the same ailment would take her mom's life too. Fast forward to 2020, and Emily's fears began to manifest before her eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c54afb1100d5fa85f9c193c3d86ef3b7.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A photo of Emily's late mother. | Source: youtube.com/East Idaho News</p><p class=dh>Her mom got ill and was taken to the hospital. After several unyielding treatments, Emily's mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The sad news tore through the family, and in a few months, the mom was gone.</p><p class=dh>Emily wasted no time taking up the role of mom for her five young siblings. Even before their mom passed on, Emily was very active in catering to everyone's needs. While her dad worked to sustain their finances, Emily juggled between school and housekeeping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5e476a1c60c5de1b095d75f43f7af3f1.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Emily and her brother, Henry looking confused on seeing The three news elves. | Source: youtube.com/East Idaho News</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>EMILY'S STORY GETS OUT</strong></p><p class=dh>Her pal <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/12/a-teenager-helping-raise-5-siblings-after-her-mothers-death-is-given-a-big-surprise-from-secret-santa/>wrote</a> in the entry letter that went to Secret Santa alongside many other people's letters. She said that Emily had an air of positivity around her despite all that the young teen was going through.</p><p class=dh>Emily was a helpful person, and she often showed compassion to others. The letter writer described her beloved friend as "the sweetest person" they had met.</p><p class=dh>The story was touching enough for Secret Santa to launch into action, immediately arranging an early Christmas present. The East Idaho News Elves were also sent to present the gift items to Emily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2cd4eaa456fc2b94a2327c914cbec612.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Emily looking amazed after receiving gifts from Secret Santa. | Source: youtube.com/East Idaho News</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE BIG SURPRISE</strong></p><p class=dh>The three news elves, including the anchor Nate, made their way to Emily's neighborhood.

Just outside the gate, Nate and the other two elves shared the good news with her.</p><p class=dh>Nate noted that there were presents for her, and she could share them with her siblings. The eighth-grader could not fathom the next few minutes as she looked on in confusion. Nate started by giving her a box filled with gift cards worth $1000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/091db983c715cb1442f4bffead0f018b.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Emily placing her head on her father's chest after breaking the good news to him. | Source: youtube.com/East Idaho News</p><p class=dh>This was to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.inspiremore.com/14-year-old-emily-secret-santa-surprise/>help</a> pay bills in selected local restaurants of her choice alongside the family.

Nate also handed her $2000 gift cards for groceries and other types of shopping.</p><p class=dh>Nate explained that she and her <a class="me a" href=#>siblings</a> could shop for clothes and shoes. The last item was yet to be <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.faithpot.com/teen-raising-siblings-secret-santa-surprise/>presented</a>, but Emily was clearly impressed.
