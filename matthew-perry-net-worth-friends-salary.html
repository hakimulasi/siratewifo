<a href=#>passed away at the age of 54</a> on Saturday, October 28, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/friends-one-embryos-episode-12-776834444.jpg><h2>What was Matthew Perry's net worth in 2023?</h2><p><a href=#>Matthew Perry</a> not only starred in the iconic <a href=#>Friends </a>series, but he also made appearances in film and TV favourites throughout his career.</p><p>He starred in movies like The Ron Clark Story,&nbsp;Fools Rush In, The Whole Nine Yards,&nbsp;and&nbsp;17 Again.&nbsp;</p><p>Perry also took up roles in TV projects like&nbsp;The Odd Couple.</p><p>As of October, the actor had an estimated net worth of $120million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MATTHEW PERRY">READ MORE ON MATTHEW PERRY</h2><p>His giant fortune was thanks to his career not only in acting but also for his work as an executive producer and screenwriter.</p><h2>How much was Matthew Perry paid for Friends?</h2><p>The TV icon played the well-recognized character, Chandler Bing, in the 90s Friends sitcom, which aired for over ten years.</p><p>In 2002, Perry and his five co-stars made history by striking the first-ever $1million per-episode pay deal, according to <a href=#>US Weekly</a>.</p><p>The cast negotiated together and threatened to quit the show if they were not paid the same.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>At the time, it was the largest-ever paycheck for a 30-minute-long TV show.</p><p>In the early days of Friends, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MarketPlace,&nbsp;</a>Perry, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer were reportedly paid $22,500 per episode.</p><p>But by the third season, the group was reportedly making $100,000 per episode.</p><p>Perry is reported to have earned at least $90million from his decade on&nbsp;Friends.</p><p>But his payout from Friends didn't stop when the series ended.</p><p>In 2004 when the show came to an end, the clever negotiation skills of the cast meant they have each made significant profits in the years since thanks to syndication payments.</p><p>While <a href=#>Warner Bros</a> earns about $1billion a year from reruns of the show,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>&nbsp;reported in 2015, the six cast members were pocketing around 2 per cent of that - an annual income of about $20million.</p><h2>How does his net worth compare to other Friends' costars?</h2><p>Although Perry's net worth is reportedly a staggering $120million, some of his Friends' costars have overtaken this figure.</p><p>His friend in the sitcom Rachel Green, played by <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, has a huge net worth of $320million, according to <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>.</p><p>And itâ€™s unsurprising, considering she's been a household name for the past two and a half decades.</p><p>Aniston has been in 70 movies and has also directed and produced her own.</p><p><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a> played Ross Geller on Friends and the love interest of Rachel Green.</p><p>His estimated net worth sits at a whopping $134million.</p><p>Schwimmer's career extended far beyond&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;and into the broader realms of TV and film.</p><p>He voiced the character Melman in the successful animated film series&nbsp;Madagascar.</p><p>And he has also ventured into producing and directing various projects including the critically acclaimed miniseries&nbsp;Band of Brothers.</p><p>Ross Geller's sister in Friends, Monica Geller, played by <a href=#>Courtney Cox</a>, is now estimated to have a net worth of around $189million.</p><p>She starred in all 236 of the show's episodes over 10 seasons between 1994 and 2004.</p><p>Outside of Friends, both before and after, she has enjoyed a successful film and television career.</p><p>Prior to Friends she notably starred in the 1994 <a href=#>Jim Carrey</a> movie Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and 19 episodes of Family Ties in the late 1980s.</p><p>After Friends, she starred in the series Dirt which lasted 20 episodes, and Cougar Town, which aired 102 episodes.</p><p>She's also best known for starring in the "Scream" franchise, having made appearances in six installments to date.</p><p>In 2023, Courteney Cox received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a>, who played heartthrob Joey Tribbiani in Friends, has an estimated net worth of of around $126million.</p><p>The actor's first on-screen appearance was in a Heinz Tomato Ketchup advert but his portrayal of Joey earned him a significant source of income, and his character ended up receiving a spin-off series titled&nbsp;Joey.</p><p>LeBlanc also entered the world of automobile culture by becoming a host of&nbsp;Top Gear.</p><p>Finally, Phoebe Buffay, played by <a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a> has an estimated net worth of roughly $110million, according to Business Insider.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She has earned accolades for her work in&nbsp;The Comeback&nbsp;and voice-acted in&nbsp;BoJack Horseman,&nbsp;a popular cartoon series.</p><p>She also starred in the cult comedy film&nbsp;Romy and Michele's High School Reunion&nbsp;and is currently working alongside Mary McCormack as an executive producer on&nbsp;25 Words or Less, the game show.</p><p class=postsid
