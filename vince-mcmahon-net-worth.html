In 1969, he undoubtedly began his career as a ringside commentator.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1970s, Vince McMahon rose to the top of his dad’s business empire. In under a decade, he and his father increased their television viewership and became the popular face of the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><p>After his father’s sudden death in 1982, Vince McMahon gained sole control of the company and rebranded the company’s name as WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vince McMahon’s Net Worth</h2><p>When it comes to Vincent Kennedy McMahon’s net worth, he has received a large portion of his <a href=#>wealth</a> as reward for his job as the chairman of the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) over the years.</p><p>Being in a prominent position, he not only invested in his father’s company but also in many business ventures such as real estate holdings, professional sports teams and TV channels.</p><p>Vince McMahon has a net worth of $2.4 billion USD as of June 2022.

However, McMahon appeared on Friday Night SmackDown, he made a brief appearance to a round of cheers, when he entered the ring.</p><p>He stormed out of the ring, dropping his mic and invoking the WWE’s “<strong>Then, Now, Forever, Together</strong>“ slogan.</p><p>Meanwhile, McMahon said in a statement, <strong>“I have pledged my complete cooperation to the Special Committee’s investigation, and I will do everything possible to support the investigation.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“I have also pledged to accept the investigation’s findings and outcome, whatever they are,” </strong>he added<strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is the Case About?</h2><p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Vince McMahon agreed to cover a secret $3 million settlement to an employee with whom he was claimed to have had an affair.</p><p>He also had agreed to pay a private settlement to a former employee with whom McMahon had allegedly had a relationship that was consensual.</p><p>So when their affair became sexual, McMahon allegedly boosted her paralegal income from $100,000 to $200,000 and “toyed” with WWE executive John Laurinaitis:</p><p>According to persons involved with the board investigation, the first email to the board stated, “My friend was so scared as she quit after Vince McMahon and lawyer Jerry paid her millions of dollars to shut up.”</p><p>And as per evidence, Vince McMahon’s personal lawyer, Mr. [Jerry] McDevitt, negotiated the money settlement.</p><p>McMahon’s lawyer told The Journal that as of now the former employee had not filed any charges of harassment against him, and that the settlement was paid with personal money.</p><p>Since April, the board had already been looking into the matter. Other nondisclosure agreements relating allegations of Mr. McMahon’s sexual misconduct were found during the investigation, as per The Journal.</p><p>The investigation was carried out by independent legal counsel appointed by the company.
