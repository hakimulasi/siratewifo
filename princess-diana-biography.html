Her parents were hoped for a male to continue the family line.</p><p>She was also referred to as “Duch” inside the family, a reference to her attitude resembling that of a duchess when she was younger.</p><p>Diana was baptized at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham on August 30, 1961.&nbsp;Sarah, Jane, and Charles were her three siblings who raised her.</p><p>One year before Diana was born, her baby brother John passed away soon after birth. Her parents’ marriage became more strained as a result of the desire for an heir, and Lady Althorp was taken to London’s Harley Street clinics to ascertain the root of the “problem”.</p><p>Charles, Diana’s younger brother, called the incident “humiliating” and said it was “a terrible time for my parents and probably the cause of their divorce because I don’t think they ever got over it.”</p><p>Diana was raised in the Sandringham estate’s Park House. Diana referred to Queen Elizabeth II, who owned the home, as “Aunt Lilibet” when she was a young girl.</p><p>Diana interacted with the Queen’s sons Prince Andrew and Prince Edward when visiting the nearby Sandringham House, where the royal family usually spent time on vacation.</p><p>Diana’s parents split when she was seven years old. Later, her mother started dating Peter Shand Kydd, whom she later wed in 1969.</p><p>When Diana’s parents divorced in 1967, she continued to reside in London with her mother, but Lord Althorp forbade his daughter from visiting Lady Althorp during the Christmas break.</p><p>Soon after, with the help of his former mother-in-law, Lady Fermoy, he was able to secure Diana’s custody. Lord Althorp wed Raine, Countess of Dartmouth, in 1976.</p><p>Diana had a particularly strained connection with her stepmother. She disliked Raine and referred to him as a “bully”. Diana once forced her to down the stairs.</p><p>Later, she recalled her childhood as being “very unstable, the whole thing,” and “very unhappy.” After her father’s subsequent elevation to the earldom of Spencer in 1975, when the family moved from Park House to Althorp, the Spencer seat in Northamptonshire, she started to be known as Lady Diana.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Princess Diana nationality</h2><p>Diana was born at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk in the United Kingdom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Princess Diana death</h2><p>Diana was killed in a car accident on August 31, 1997, in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris while the driver evaded paparazzi.</p><p>Dodi Fayed, her traveling companion, and Henri Paul, the driver and acting security manager of the Hôtel Ritz Paris, also perished in the collision.</p><p>Trevor Rees-Jones, Dodi’s father’s bodyguard, survived the collision but was left with a critical brain injury.</p><p>An all-time high of 32.10 million British television viewers tuned in to the televised burial on September 6, making it one of the most watched events in British history. Millions more people throughout the world viewed the event.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Princess Diana age</h2><p>Diana was born on July 1st, 1961, hence she was 36 years of age at the time of her death.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Prince Diana net worth</h2><p>Diana had a net worth estimated to be about $25 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Princess Diana height and weight</h2><p>Diana stood at a height of 1.78m and weighed 59kg.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Princess Diana career</h2><p>Initially, Diana was educated at home under the guidance of her nanny, Gertrude Allen.</p><p>She started her formal education at King’s Lynn, Norfolk’s Silfield Private School before transferring at the age of nine to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school close to Thetford.</p><p>In 1973, she enrolled in Sevenoaks, Kent’s West Heath Girls’ School alongside her sisters. She struggled academically and twice failed her O-levels.</p><p>She received a prize from West Heath in recognition of her exceptional sense of community. When she turned sixteen, she moved out of West Heath.</p><p>Charles, her brother, remembers her as being quite reserved before that point. As a skilled pianist, she displayed musical prowess. She also excelled in ballet and tap dancing, swimming, and diving.</p><p>Diana was a nanny for Philippa and Jeremy Whitaker in Hampshire for three months in 1978.</p><p>Diana returned to London, where she lived in her mother’s apartment with two school friends, after spending one term at Rougemont, Switzerland’s Institut Alpin Videmanette (a finishing school).</p><p>She worked at several low-paying jobs in London while taking an advanced cooking degree. Prior to missing three months of work due to an accident while skiing, she taught dancing to young people.</p><p>She later got a job as a playgroup pre-school assistant, cleaned up occasionally for her sister Sarah and a few of her friends, and served as the hostess for events.</p><p>She worked as a nursery teacher’s assistant at the Young England School in Pimlico and briefly served as a nanny for the Robertsons, an American family residing in London.</p><p>Her mother gave her an apartment at Coleherne Court in Earl’s Court for her 18th birthday in July 1979. Until February 25th, 1981, she shared an apartment with three other people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Princess Diana family and siblings</h2><p>Diana was born to Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp Roche, and John Spencer, Viscount Althorp.
