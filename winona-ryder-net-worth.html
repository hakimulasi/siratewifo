Winona Ryder made her film debut in the 1986 film "Lucas." From there she quickly rose to prominence in the late 1980s and 1990s with a series of eclectic and iconic roles. She played the gothic teenager Lydia in "Beetlejuice," followed by the lovable Veronica in the dark comedy "Heathers." Her ability to oscillate between dark and light characters became evident as she starred in the poignant "Edward Scissorhands" and the literary adaptation of "Little Women," for which she received an Academy Award nomination.</p><p>As her career progressed, Winona took on more mature roles, delivering a critically acclaimed performance in "Girl, Interrupted" and showcasing her versatility in "The Age of Innocence." However, her career faced challenges in the early 2000s, with fewer roles coming her way. A triumphant return to the spotlight came when she was cast in the hit Netflix series "Stranger Things" as Joyce Byers, a role that introduced her to a new generation of fans.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-205976 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Winona-Ryder.jpg alt width=594 height=412 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-205976 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Ryder was born Winona Laura Horowitz in Winona, Minnesota, on October 29, 1971. She was given her middle name because of her parents' close friendship with writer Aldous Huxley's wife Laura. She derived her stage name from <a href=# title="Mitch Ryder Net Worth">Mitch Ryder</a>, a soul and rock singer. When she was cast in her first film, the director asked her how she wanted her name to appear. A Mitch Ryder album was playing in the background, her dad being a huge fan, so she quickly came up with the pseudonym Ryder.</p><p>When Ryder was seven years old, the family moved to Rainbow, a commune near Elk, California. They lived with seven other families on a remote property that had no electricity. Ryder, at the encouragement of her parents who were both writers and editors with a roster of famous author friends, began to read fervently, devouring books like <a href=# title="J.D. Salinger Net Worth">J.D. Salinger</a>'s "The Catcher in the Rye." After three years, the family moved to Petaluma, California. Ryder was bullied extensively throughout junior high and high school. She began taking acting classes at the American Conservatory Theater in nearby San Francisco. When she was 12, she had an accident and nearly drowned, which caused her to develop severe aquaphobia (which would haunt her later in life when she starred in "Alien Ressurection" and had to do scenes in the water).</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Winona Ryder made her acting debut in the 1986 comedy "Lucas", in which she starred opposite <a href=# title="Corey Haim Net Worth">Corey Haim</a> and <a href=# title="Charlie Sheen Net Worth">Charlie Sheen</a>. Her next film was 1987's "Square Dance", and was praised for her role by the Los Angeles Times, among other critics. However, it was her role as goth teenager Lydia Deetz in <a href=# title="Tim Burton Net Worth">Tim Burton</a>'s "Beetlejuice" that earned her both critical and commercial recognition. "Beetlejuice" was a box office success and the film received positive reviews. Winona was still in high school at the time, and this only perpetuated the bullying she experienced, with kids teasing her for being a "witch." Next up, Ryder landed a leading role in 1988's "Heathers". The film flopped at the box office, but was loved by fans, and the film went on to reach cult classic status.</p><h2 id=90s><strong>90s</strong></h2><p>Winona once again worked with Tim Burton when she played the leading role opposite <a href=# title="Johnny Depp Net Worth">Johnny Depp</a> in the 1990 fantasy film "Edward Scissorhands." This film was her biggest box office success yet, grossing $86 million and critical praise. Later that year, Ryder snagged her ninth role, in the comedy-drama "Mermaids", co-starring Cher. The next year, Ryder starred alongside <a href=# title="Daniel Day-Lewis Net Worth">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> in "The Age of Innocence", helmed by director <a href=# title="Martin Scorsese Net Worth">Martin Scorsese</a>. She picked up a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Oscar nomination in the same category for her performance. Ryder was slated to star in "Broken Dreams" with actor <a href=# title="River Phoenix Net Worth">River Phoenix</a>, but the film was shelved due to his sudden death.</p><p>1994 was a huge year for Winona, starting with the release of Ryder's next film, <a href=# title="Ben Stiller Net Worth">Ben Stiller</a>'s Generation X drama "Reality Bites." She received much critical acclaim for her starring role, but the film did not gross a substantial amount of money. Later in 1994, Ryder gained more exposure when she played the lead role of Josephine March in "Little Women." She received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance. Her next starring role was in 1995's "How to Make an American Quilt."</p><p>In 1997, Ryder appeared in "Alien Resurrection" alongside <a href=# title="Sigourney Weaver Net Worth">Sigourney Weaver</a>. The film was largely considered the least successful of the "Alien" series, but it still grossed $161 million worldwide and drew positive reviews. In 1999, Ryder starred in and served as the executive producer for "Girl, Interrupted", alongside Angelia Jolie and <a href=# title="Whoopi Goldberg Net Worth">Whoopi Goldberg</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-304719 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Winona-Ryder-1.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1588px) 100vw, 1588px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-304719 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty)</p><h2 id=2000s-beyond><strong>2000s and Beyond</strong></h2><p>Ryder took a five-year acting hiatus beginning in 2001 following a highly publicized shoplifting incident. Before her hiatus, she had filmed two movies: "Mr. Deeds" starring <a href=# title="Adam Sandler Net Worth">Adam Sandler</a> and science fiction drama "Simone." After her hiatus, she appeared in 2006's <a href=# title="Richard Linklater Net Worth">Richard Linklater</a> film "A Scanner Darkly," 2007's "Sex and Death 101", "Top Ten", and 2008's "The Last Word." In 2009, she appeared in "The Informers" and "Star Trek." She flew under the radar during this period, appearing in small indie films and not making many public appearances.</p><p>In 2016, Ryder made a big comeback when she began starring in Netflix's horror series "Stranger Things," created by the Duffer Brothers. She plays single mother Joyce Byers whose 12-year-old vanishes mysteriously. She went on to star in season 2 and 3 of the series and is slated to star in season four. In 2020, Ryder starred in HBO's limited series "The Plot Against America." Also in 2020, she played Lacey Groin in "Sarah Cooper: Everything's Fine." Her recent films include "Destination Wedding" (2018), "Gone in theNight" (2022), and "Haunted Mansion" (2023). Ryder is set to reprise her role as Lydia Deetz in "Beetlejuice 2."</p><h2 id=stranger-things-salary><strong>Stranger Things Salary</strong></h2><p>Winona made $100,000 per episode for the first two seasons of "Stranger Things". There were 17 episodes during this period, which works out to around $1.7 million for the two seasons. Starting ahead of the third season, Winona received a raise to $350,000 per episode. That worked out to right around $3 million for the third season. For the upcoming season five, Ryder received a big pay bump to a reported $9.5 million for the eight episodes, which works out to just under $1.2 million per episode.</p><h2 id=accolades><strong>Accolades</strong></h2><p>Playing diverse roles, Winona has won various awards and recognitions, such as a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination in the same category for her role in Scorsese's "The Age of Innocence" in 1993. She also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her portrayal of tomboyish Jo in 1994's "Little Women." In 2010, Ryder was honored with a star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California. Ryder was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2016 for "Stranger Things." She has also been nominated for seven Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Ryder has had a series of high-profile romances over the years. Ryder was engaged to Johnny Depp from 1990-1993. After their breakup, she dated musician <a href=# title="Dave Pirner Net Worth">Dave Pirner</a> of Soul Asylum. She dated <a href=# title="Matt Damon Net Worth">Matt Damon</a> for a few years in the late '90s. Since 2011, she has been in a relationship with Scott Mackinlay Hahn.</p><h2 id=shoplifting-incident><strong>Shoplifting Incident</strong></h2><p>In December 2001, Ryder was arrested for shoplifting at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 dollars worth of designer clothes and accessories. She was charged with three felonies against her: grand theft, shoplifting, and vandalism. In 2002, she was sentenced to three years probation, 480 hours of community service, fines, and restitution to the department store. The felonies were reduced to misdemeanors in June 2004. Ryder has explained in interviews that the incident occurred during a painful time in her life when she was clinically depressed, and also attributed her actions to heavy painkiller use, rendering her judgement unstable. The physician who prescribed her dosage of painkillers has subsequently had his medical license revoked by the Medical Board of California.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1995, Winona paid $1.3 million for a home in San Francisco, her hometown. She listed this home for sale in November 2020 for $5 million. About a year before listing it for sale, Winona put the property up for rental at $15,000 per month.</p><p>In 1998, Winona paid $2.6 million for a 1936 Spanish-style home in Los Angeles. She sold the home in 2010 for $4.1 million. Two years earlier she sold an apartment in New York City for $2.2 million.</p><p>Winona may still own a home in Hollywood, another in Beverly Hills and an apartment in New York City.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMSqus6nmGaqqZmys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwinona-ryder-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwinona-ryder-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwinona-ryder-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwinona-ryder-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwinona-ryder-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwinona-ryder-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./riverdale-season-7-everything-to-know-about-the-final-season.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./riverdale-season-7-everything-to-know-about-the-final-season.html>'Riverdale' Season 7: Everything to Know About the Final Season</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-do-they-call-him-jimmy-in-8-mile.html>Why do they call him jimmy in 8 mile</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-do-they-call-him-jimmy-in-8-mile.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
