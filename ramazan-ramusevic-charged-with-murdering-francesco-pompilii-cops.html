His son, Skender Cobaj, 51, was cut on the hands and later released from the hospital.</p><p>MaryAnn Nelson, 72, said the deceased victim was “a great neighbor” who would “give you the shirt off his back.”</p><p>She said she saw Pompilii’s wife screaming at her husband’s alleged killer as police whisked him away.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Pompilii “was friendly to everyone,” including his alleged killer, neighbors said, <span class=credit>Frank Pompilii/Facebook</span></figure><p>“‘I hope you die! I hope you die!’” the devastated wife yelled, according to Nelson.</p><p>Nelson’s husband, Bill, called the stabbing spree “totally senseless” and said it was perpetrated for seemingly “no reason.”</p><p>One resident who knew both Pompilii and Ramusevic said the elderly victim “never harmed a fly.”</p><p>“He was always smiling, saying hello. Who would harm a man like that?”</p><p>Pompilii, Cobaj and Ramusevic frequently chatted, the resident said.</p><p>“They were always hanging out and talking. I don’t know what they were talking about, but they knew each other very well,” the neighbor noted. “They always have some conversation, the two old guys and the younger guy.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Frank and Doreen Pompilii were married for more than 50 years. <span class=credit>Frank Pompilii/Facebook</span></figure><p>The resident said he would say “Hi” to the accused killer, who once owned a nearby pizzeria, but “he never answered back.”</p><p>He added that he didn’t think the assailant “was friendly with anyone else” besides the man he allegedly killed.</p><p>Pompilii, meanwhile, “was friendly to everyone,” the neighbor said.&nbsp;</p><p>“He was the nicest man you could ever meet — very kind, very generous, always a smile on his face.”</p><p>Pompilii was a father of two and grandfather of six who had been married to his wife, Doreen, for more than 50 years, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Staten Island Advance</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Neighbors say that Ramusevic, who was “having problems,” seemed to have lashed out in an unprovoked fit of rage. <span class=credit>Michael Dalton</span></figure><p>A native of Abruzze, Italy, Pompilii arrived in America at age 17 and worked for decades making and cutting uniforms for companies on Staten Island and in the Bronx.</p><p>Another neighbor, Terence Bennett, 59, said he’d known Pompilii since he was a teen.</p><p>The older man and his wife “took us places, movies and stuff like that. … I’m upset,” Bennett said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Frank was a nice guy,” he added. “He was always helping people out. He took me to pick up my car last summer. I used to walk my dog and stopped and chit-chat with him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma25fp66urdmapWaqkaLCtLHVoppmm5iWv6ixw2auoqyYYrq2vsOeqaKml2Kzs63NnJysm59ivbC5z6KjoqFdmLyxv44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2framazan-ramusevic-charged-with-murdering-francesco-pompilii-cops.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2framazan-ramusevic-charged-with-murdering-francesco-pompilii-cops.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2framazan-ramusevic-charged-with-murdering-francesco-pompilii-cops.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2framazan-ramusevic-charged-with-murdering-francesco-pompilii-cops.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2framazan-ramusevic-charged-with-murdering-francesco-pompilii-cops.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2framazan-ramusevic-charged-with-murdering-francesco-pompilii-cops.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-masked-singer-season-7-finale-recap-firefly-ringmaster-prince-1235270328.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-masked-singer-season-7-finale-recap-firefly-ringmaster-prince-1235270328.html>The Masked Singer Finale Reveals Identities of Firefly, Ringmaster and Prince: Heres</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pete-wentz-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html>Pete Wentzs biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pete-wentz-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
