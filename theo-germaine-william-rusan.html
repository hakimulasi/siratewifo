Rusan then sent a piece of fan mail to Theo, which was the first fan mail the latter ever received.</p><p>The duo wouldn’t fall in love for a few years, but eventually, their relationship blossomed, and the rest is history. The pair are head over heels for one another and are often together on several red-carpet events. From their social media, it is evident that the lovebirds are madly in love. In addition, they have <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">even adopted</a> two cats and post several adorable pictures together.</p><p>Nonetheless, we wish the duo the very best in their lives.
