Ciara is a single mother having had a son, Zahir Future, with rapper Future.</p><p class=dh>"I prayed for a God-fearing man. I prayed for discernment. I prayed for wisdom to learn from the wisdom that I've gained from the experience that I'm going through," the incredible singer stated during the conversation with Angie Martinez. "I prayed for a man that loved kids, because, obviously me having my son, if you're gonna love me you've gotta love him. I prayed for a man that was worldly as well. Because I love to explore so someone that was going to teach my world, that was important to me. I was ready to level up."</p><p class=dh>She then implored fans to "be specific" about what they want when they pray.</p><p class=dh>Wilson Russell, who plays as a quarterback for Seattle Seahawks, is currently the highest paid player in NFL history after signing a contract of $140 million with the football team.</p><p class=dh>Ciara and Wilson were rumored to have met in 2015 during the wrap party for the NBC Summer Series, "I can do that."

Ciara told cosmopolitan in an interview that the period of celibacy was the strongest resistance to temptation because hugs and kisses were involved, but they had to be careful not to go too far.</p><p class=dh>The pair became engaged during a vacation in Seychelles after the quarterback proposed with a 16-carat ring and the couple wasted no time in getting married four months after. The marriage took place at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England. Hundred family and friends were present. Celebrities such as La La Anthony, Kelly Rowland, and Serena Williams, were the singer's bridesmaids. Ciara and Wilson have since had a daughter together, the beauty named Sienna Princess Wilson.</p><p class=dh>The couple was seen together at the Vanity fair Oscars party earlier this year where they looked terrific in Versace outfits. Wilson was seen helping the singer adjust her dress as they took photographs on the red carpet in a video shared by her. The gesture didn't go unnoticed by followers who shared in Ciara's happiness and applauded the Wilson as seen by the comments under the Instagram post.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Wilson</a> is a hopeless romantic and a loving husband who shows off Ciara on his Instagram and occasionally takes her on fancy date nights. He has also been a loving stepdad to her son despite several feuds with the boy's father, Future, over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpsamhmZ3qktcCrmGaoopbGpr6MrJ%2BeZaCnrrqxw2aZnp6fp7Juv8eeZKadpGK1b7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f151062-ciara-prayer-she-prayed-before-she-met-h-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f151062-ciara-prayer-she-prayed-before-she-met-h-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f151062-ciara-prayer-she-prayed-before-she-met-h-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f151062-ciara-prayer-she-prayed-before-she-met-h-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f151062-ciara-prayer-she-prayed-before-she-met-h-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f151062-ciara-prayer-she-prayed-before-she-met-h-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daniel-cormier-says-brock-lesnar-will-next-opponent.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daniel-cormier-says-brock-lesnar-will-next-opponent.html>Daniel Cormier Says Brock Lesnar Will Be His Next Opponent</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christian-guardino-net-worth-135177.html>Christian Guardino Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christian-guardino-net-worth-135177.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
